# How Lens Publications Work?

### What are Publications?

Publications in Lens Protocol are the primary content created by users. They can be posts, comments, or mirrors. Publications are posted to a user's ProfileNFTs and are stored in their wallet. Each publication has a ContentURI that points to the specific content it contains, which can be text, images, videos, or other types of content stored on decentralized protocols like IPFS or Arweave, or centralized storage providers like AWS S3. Publications also have attached modules, such as a Collect Module and a Reference Module, which control functionalities like minting the publication into an NFT and determining who can comment and mirror the publication.
